# VisionAndPerceptionProject

This is the project for the Vision and Perception 2022/2023 course at Sapienza.

The idea is to implement style transfer using two images, one for the content and one for the style. This will be achieved using a VGG19 model as baseline. Some changes will be made to the model to study the differences in the results.
